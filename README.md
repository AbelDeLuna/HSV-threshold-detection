# OpenCV-Small-Project
This is a portion of a larger project I've been working on. This sections purpose is to detect a specific shade of color and highlight the object. 'CamShift Object Tracking.py' is capable of finding the closest pixel values to the threshold within a user selected region of the window.

##How to run
1. Ensure that Python 3.4+ is installed
2. Install OpenCV moduel
3. Run `python CamShift Object Tracking.py`
4. To adjust HSV thresholds, change the array values in lns 5&6
